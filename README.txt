This counter works perfectly if you install JSON-server package to the folder you want run the program from. 

npm install -g json-server  in the terminal

to run JSON server run this command.

json-server db.json

Since this is a practice project with no real backend and the data gets saved in db.json the only way to clear the database to actually erase it from the file.
